This our  contribution to the 4k intro compo
at Assembly 2018 demo party.

  Code:                   TS and Firehawk  
  Music:                               oo

To run the intro, you'll need a 64-bit Intel
system  with MacOS 10.12 or later and a fast
GPU such as a GTX 1080 or better.

Before  running the compo versions, set your
display to the correct  resolution in system
settings.  Additionally,  please  make  sure
that your audio device is capable of 44100Hz
audio at  16-bit  resolution.  Also,  please
ignore the error messages - it's normal. :D 

If you are unable to run the  compo versions
on your system, try the "compatibility" ones
instead.  They use the standard  linker, use
a real time clock source, set the resolution
for you and exit cleanly.  The compatibility
versions also support Intel GPUs.

The executable code for the intro is written
in x86 assembly and uses the standard ABI to
call the Cocoa  framework to  initialize the
OpenGL  context.  The  actual effect is,  as
usual, fully  written in GLSL.  The music is
rendered  real-time  using   the   Komposter
player.
